# Human-Activity-Recognition-HAR-using-UCI-Dataset
This repository showcases a comprehensive exploration and implementation of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using the UCI dataset. The project is divided into two major tasks, leveraging both classic machine learning techniques and deep learning architectures to analyze and classify human activities.
Also we did the model comparision of varius dataset in this UCI dataset my result -
